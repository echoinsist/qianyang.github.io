	  Hi, I am currently a researcher at the Institute of Brain and Psychological Sciences of Sichuan Normal University in China. I am generally interested in the interaction and integration of affect (negative vs. positive)/motivation (defensive vs. approach) and cognitive control. I am also interested in how mindfulness influences the cognitive processing.

          <p>
            I received my PhD in Cap-lab with Gilles Pourtois at Ghent University. During when (2016-2020), I mostly focused on the neurocognitive mechanisms of favorable influences of negative affect/defensive motivation on cognitive control, and how does it change with further (down-) regulation of negative affect by means of emotion regulation.

          <p>
           I did my master in Cognitive Control lab supervised by Antao Chen at Southwest University. During this period (2013-2016), my research mainly focused on emotional conflict. I investigated how the processing priority of negative emotion improved emotional conflict control, as well as how was the processing of emotional conflict modulated by perceptual load.

  <p>Outside of academia, I enjoy singing, doing ballet practice, and linking random thoughts in daily life with the findings obtained in the laboratory. </p>
